# Stellarjob

(Note: I've now taken down the bot, so tweeting won't work. You can of course run a similar bot yourself though.)

Bot for upvoting people's via Twitter. Usage is simple:

```
@stellarjob +++@thegdb cool bot!
```

See https://gdb.github.io/stellarjob/ for more details.

## Status

This project is pretty alpha. It's largely a proof-of-concept / a
demonstration of the kinds of things you can build on top of
Stellar. Use it, have fun, extend it.
